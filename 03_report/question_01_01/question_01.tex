\textsl{How would you run a randomized controlled double-blind experiment to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine? Write down procedures for the experimenter to follow.}\\

Answer:\\
The target of the study is running a randomized, controlled and double-blind experiment as mentioned in the lecture. This can be achieved by two different aspects: The choice of the participants and the architecture of the test.\\

The participants should be randomly chosen from a set of a population, in which we want to analyze for example the effects of an injection. If we want to test the immune answer of all Europeans we should make sure, that all European countries are considered. Different parameters like the sex or age of a person should be considered as well. From that pool we draw a set, which gets the injection of the vaccine (treatment group), and a different set, which gets an injection of a placebo (control group).\\

The architecture of the test should take into account, that neither the patient nor the experimenter should know, in which of the two groups individuals belong to (double-blindness). In addition to the e.g. death rate due to a disease a parameter of general death rate due to other reasons should be included to make sure that the two groups can be compared to each other.\\
