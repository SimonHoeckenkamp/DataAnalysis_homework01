\textsl{In both experiments, neither control groups nor the no-consent groups got the vaccine. Yet the no-consent groups had a lower rate of polio compared to the control group. Why could that be?}\\

Answer:\\
The no-consent groups of both experiments had comparable infection rates, whereas the comparability should not be overestimated due to differences in the study setup. In both cases the students knew that they were not vaccinated and could have behaved more cautious to prevent infections.\\

They control group of the second study contrarily might have thought that they were vaccinated and could have behaved less cautious. Students could have been meeting with friends like the vaccinated group, but without the sufficient security of a vaccination. The cause of the differing numbers could based in these different behaviors.\\
