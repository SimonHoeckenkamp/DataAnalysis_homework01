
Question 1.5.11:\\	
\textsl{Suppose there is no bias and no teams are racing for the same test, so there is no misconduct and poor practices. Will publications still likely to be false than true?}\\

Answer:\\
Both, bias and number of competing teams, have a negative effect on the PPV. Even if both are missing, there might still be a chance that a relationship is published, which does not exist. These two sources of uncertainty are merely minimized, others might still exist.\\

This risk increases with a high R value. This could root for example in a highly multidimensional data set, in which pairwise correlations are investigated.\\
