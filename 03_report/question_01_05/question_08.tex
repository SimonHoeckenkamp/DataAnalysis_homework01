
Question 1.5.8:\\	
\textsl{ Show that the extent of repeated independent testing by different teams can reduce the probability of the research being true.}\\
	
\textsl{Start by writing the PPV as}

\[ PPV = \frac{\mathbf{P}(\textrm{\textsl{relation exists, at least one of the n repetitions finds significant}})}{\mathbf{P}(\textrm{\textsl{at least one of the n repetitions finds significant}})} \]

\textsl{(Note that this does not include a bias term and you will not need one to answer this question.)}\\

Answer:\\

\[ PPV = \frac{\mathbf{P}(\textrm{\textsl{relation exists, at least one of the n repetitions finds significant}})}{\mathbf{P}(\textrm{\textsl{at least one of the n repetitions finds significant}})}\]
\[	= \frac{R(1-\beta^n)}{R+1-(1-\alpha)^n - R\beta^n} \] 

with $\alpha$ as significance level and $\beta$ as type II error rate.\\

To show that the $PPV$ decreases with increasing $n$, we have to check whether the term \[\frac{\partial(PPV)}{\partial n} < 0, \forall n \in \{1,2,...\} \]
holds.\\

This is indeed true for $1-\beta \ge \alpha$ according to the article "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False".
