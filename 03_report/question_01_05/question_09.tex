\textsl{What would make bias or increasing teams testing the same hypothesis not decrease PPV? (Assuming $\alpha = 0.05$)}\\


Answer:\\
The PPV can be increased by increasing the $R$ value. This can be done e.g. by limiting the number of variables, which should be analyzed to the most likely parameters.\\

A further approach is to increase the power ($1-\beta$) of a study. But this way is not possible due to the problem definition that $\alpha$ is hold constant and both parameters interact with each other.
